# Introduction to Database Systems

This repository contains coursework and assignments for **CSDS 341: Introduction to Database Systems**. The materials explore fundamental concepts in database design, query languages, and data management through theoretical problems and practical implementations.

## Overview

The work presented here examines how data is structured, queried, and managed in relational database systems. Topics include:
- Entity-Relationship modeling and relational schema design
- Relational algebra, relational calculus, and SQL
- Normalization theory and functional dependencies
- Query processing and optimization
- Transaction management and concurrency control
- Storage structures and indexing

Each assignment integrates theoretical understanding with practical application to illustrate how database principles support efficient and reliable data management.
